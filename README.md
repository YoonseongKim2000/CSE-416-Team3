## Problem Statement
**Problem**
- Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is a very entertaining tabletop role-playing game that many people enjoy. Unfortunately, playing this game requires the players to organise available times to meet up physically. In addition, the “Dungeon Master” must prepare game sessions, which may involve allocating resources such as time and money for world-building aspects, such as background and character art, to enhance the player experience. Therefore, we need to increase accessibility.

**Solution**
- Our solution is to develop a web application that uses AI services to assist the process of creating art assets such as backgrounds, characters, battlemaps, items, creatures, and more for D&D-style roleplaying and world-building. Our platform will also provide users with the ability to organise and manage assets generated by AI. In addition, if time permits, add a function where the “Dungeon Master” and players can role-play on our platform.
